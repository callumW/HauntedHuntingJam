## Mechanics
* Nights get longer and longer
* Monster cannot enter the light
* Player has a wind-up flashlight (or some form of limited-lifespan-light)
* Player needs to harvest trees to get wood to keep main fire alive (to keep monster away from sick wife)
* Player can throw/place lit torches (which have limited lifespan) to keep monster at bay
* As player harvests trees they do not grow back (so player must venture further and further away from safety of the light)
